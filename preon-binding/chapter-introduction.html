    <p>
      Decoding a compressed data format in Java can be quite a mundane
      task. This chapter will hopefully convince you that it does not
      need to be all that complicated. Preon aims to provide a simple
      and powerful solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter will introduce the most important principles behind
      Preon. Don't expect this chapter to be an exhaustive reference
      guide for everything Preon has to offer. Completeness is not
      considered to be achieved if there is nothing else to add; it is
      considered to be achieved if there is nothing left to be taken
      out. The sole objective of this chapter is to prevent surprises
      once you start to use Preon.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="2.&nbsp;Declarative Binding"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="d200e11">2.&nbsp;Declarative Binding</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      Preon is not just a library allowing you to access bits in a
      bitstream, or a library that has a number of convenience
      mechansisms allowing you read data from a compressed bitstream
      encoded format. It is much more than that, and - just like IoC
      - it obeys the Holywood paradigm: "don't call us, we call
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Preon would just have been a library of functions
      facilitating different compression mechanisms, then you would
      have been required to load the decoded data into your own data
      structures yourself. But Preon turns that arround: you just
      provide it the blueprints of the data structure, and Preon
      will make sure the data gets loaded into the appropriate
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the big question is of course: how does Preon know how to
      load data from a sequence of bits and reconstruct a data
      structure? What is the recipe? It turns out, the recipe is the
      data structure itself; it's just classes and attributes,
      period. And in case the information provided by the data
      structure is not enough, we will just augment it using
      annotations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, let's look at an example.
      <a class="xref" href="#example-rectangle" title="Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;First data structure">Example&nbsp;1, &#8220;First data structure&#8221;</a>
      defines a data structure
      defining the coordinates of the two points defining a
      rectangle, in some coordinate system.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-rectangle"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;First data structure</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">class Rectangle {
private int x1;
private int y1;
private int x2;
private int y2;
}
      </pre>
    </div></div><br class="example-break">
    <p>
      Let's just say that the data would be encoded on disk as a
      sequence of four 32-bit integers. In that case, this is the way
      you would decode a Rectangle from a file:
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">
byte[] in = new byte[] {
  0, 0, 0, 1,
  0, 0, 0, 2,
  0, 0, 0, 3, 
  0, 0, 0, 4
};
Codec&lt;Rectangle&gt; codec = Codecs.create(Rectangle.class);
Rectangle rect = Codecs.decode(codec, in);
    </pre>
    <p>
      That's how easy it is. Although... To be perfectly honest, the
      example is not entirely complete yet. If you would use the code
      as-is, you would not get anything at all. (Well, an empty
      Rectangle, maybe.) Problem is, Preon does
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      assume anything unless you explicitly
      specify at least something. In order to tell Preon that it needs
      to decode the x1, y1, x2 and y2 fields, you will need to
      explicitly state it in the definition of the data structure,
      like this:
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-rectangle-annotated"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;First data structure annotated</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">class Rectangle {
  @Bound private int x1;
  @Bound private int y1;
  @Bound private int x2;
  @Bound private int y2;
}</pre>
    </div></div><br class="example-break">
    <p>
      If you run the same code now, you will get a populated
      Rectangle.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="3.&nbsp;Convention over configuration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="d200e29">3.&nbsp;Convention over configuration</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      So, binding a Java data structure to its encoded
      representation seems to be fairly easy. However, Preon intends
      to support bitstream encoded data. That is, in many cases you
      want don't want to allocate the full 32 bits for decoding an
      integer, and you would just rely on a couple of bits
      instead. Or what if you don't want big endian byte order, but
      little endian byte order instead?
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this turns out to be additional configuration only. If
      you just specify the @Bound annotation, you basically tell
      Preon to use its default mapping to decode an integer. And by
      default, it will assume big endian byte order, and decode an
      integer using 32 bits. If you want to change that, you just
      need to tell Preon to do so, using other annotations, or
      (sometimes) other annotation attributes.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-two-bytes"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Encoding integers using two bytes</b></p><div class="example-contents">

      before to make Preon allocate only two bytes (16 bits) per
      number.
      <a class="xref" href="#">???</a>
      illustrates
      how to change byte order.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-two-bytes-little-endian"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Encoding integers using little endian byte order</b></p><div class="example-contents">

  <div class="section" title="4.&nbsp;More than just numbers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="d200e42">4.&nbsp;More than just numbers</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      Preon is not just about decoding numbers. By default, it
      already supports much more than that. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">
// Will just read one bit, interpreting 1 as true, and 0 als false
@Bound boolean visible;

// Reads a String from a fixed number of bytes
@BoundString(size="10") String value;

// Reads a bit from the in, and interprets it as an enum value,
// interpreting the number as its ordinal value.
@BoundNumber(size="1") Type type;</pre>
    <p>
      The first example is a good example of convention over
      configuration; an @Bound annoation on a boolean attribute will
      cause Preon to read one bit, and interpret it as true in case
      it's the value 1, and false otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The String example illustrates one way of decoding
      Strings. Note that (in this case) the size attribute denotes
      <span class="emphasis"><em>the number of bytes</em></span>
      and not the number of
      bits. In this case, the bytes read will be interpreted as
      US-ASCII.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third example illustrates how an type-safe enum value is
      bound to the bit in. Again, it relies on an existing
      annotation that we have already seen before: the @BoundNumber
      annotation specifies how a certain numeric value needs to be
      read. That numeric value read needs to correspond to the
      ordinal value of one of the enum's values.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="5.&nbsp;Composite content"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-composite-content">5.&nbsp;Composite content</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      The examples that we have seen so far were all pretty simple:
      in all cases, it was just about a sequence of attributes. But
      what if - in your format - you have have some higher-level
      conceptual organization of some elements? How would you need
      to deal with that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take our Rectangle from
      <a class="xref" href="#example-rectangle-annotated" title="Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;First data structure annotated">Example&nbsp;2, &#8220;First data structure annotated&#8221;</a>
      as an example. What if we want
      it to have a fill and border color as well? Would this be the
      solution?
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">@Bound int fillRed;
@Bound int fillGreen;
@Bound int fillBlue;
@Bound int borderRed;
@Bound int borderGreen;
@Bound int borderBlue;</pre>
    <p>
      ... or would you rather have this?
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">@Bound RgbColor fillColor;
@Bound RgbColor borderColor;</pre>
    <p>
      I hope you agree with me that the second option would be the
      preferred one. And it turns out this is possible. If you
      define your RgbColor class as in<a class="xref" href="#example-rgb-color" title="Example&nbsp;5.&nbsp;RGB Color">Example&nbsp;5, &#8220;RGB Color&#8221;</a>, then you
      <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span>
      used the RgbColor type as attributes
      in other classes.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-rgb-color"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;5.&nbsp;RGB Color</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">class RgbColor {
  @Bound int red;
  @Bound int green;
  @Bound int blue;
}</pre>
    </div></div><br class="example-break">
    <p>
      It's imporant to emphasize that - from a processing
      expectations point of view - there is no difference between
      both options. Bot options will result in 6 numeric values
      being read consecutively. However, the second allows you to
      stick with the conceptual organization of your file, results
      in less code and makes it easier to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just to complete the example,
      <a class="xref" href="#example-rectangle-colored" title="Example&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Colored Rectangle">Example&nbsp;6, &#8220;Colored Rectangle&#8221;</a>
      gives the source code of
      the Rectangle supporting colors.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-rectangle-colored"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Colored Rectangle</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">class Rectangle {
  @Bound private RgbColor fillColor;
  @Bound private RgbColor borderColor;
  @Bound private int x1;
  @Bound private int y1;
  @Bound private int x2;
  @Bound private int y2;

    </div></div><br class="example-break">
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="6.&nbsp;Inheritance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="d200e70">6.&nbsp;Inheritance</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      In the previous section (<a class="xref" href="#section-composite-content" title="5.&nbsp;Composite content">Section&nbsp;5, &#8220;Composite content&#8221;</a>), we saw one way of
      factoring out commonalities. Preon allows you to factor out
      recurring snippets of content and use those definitions at
      various places. However, it is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      the
      only way to organize content. In this section, I will show you
      another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a class="xref" href="#example-rectangle-colored" title="Example&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Colored Rectangle">Example&nbsp;6, &#8220;Colored Rectangle&#8221;</a>
      defines just one
      shape. And of course, that shape also defines some color
      attributes. But what if your application defines more
      shapes. And what if you want all of those shapes to define the
      same color attributes?
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to facilitate scenarios like these, Preon supports
      inheritance. That is, subclasses will
      <span class="emphasis"><em>allways</em></span>
      inherit the bindings defined by
      the superclass. This allows you to define color bindings on a
      Shape superclass, and have all of the other shape-specific
      attributes on the various Shape subclsses.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-shape-inheritance"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Shape Inheritance</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">
class Shape {
  @Bound fillColor;
  @Bound lineColor;
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  @Bound private int x1;
  @Bound private int y1;
  @Bound private int x2;
  @Bound private int y2;
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  @Bound int centerX;
  @Bound int centerY;
  @Bound int radius;
}</pre>
    </div></div><br class="example-break">
    <p>
      When Preon is required to decode a subclass, it will always
      first process the inherited bindings. In case of a Rectangle,
      it will first decode the colors it inherited from Shape, and
      only then the attributes of the rectangle itself.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="7.&nbsp;Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="d200e83">7.&nbsp;Lists</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      The 'struct'-type of support highlighted in the previous
      sections is an important concept, but not sufficient. We also
      need a 'sequence' concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Preon, the @BoundList annotation allows you to address all
      of these 'sequencing' concerns. And the annotation driven
      approach makes it fairly easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's just say you want to store a pseudo-Mondriaan type of
      painting, existing of colored rectangles only. In that case,
      you could use code like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">
class PseudoMondriaan {
  @BoundList(type=Rectangle.class, size="20") 
  Rectangle[] rectangles;
}</pre>
    <p>
      The code given above simply states that - whenever you want to
      decode a PseudoMondriaan, read 20 Rectangle instances
      according to its specifications, and store them as them as the
      attribute 'rectangles'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is of course questionable if it is realistic to expect
      that every PseudoMondriaan contains exactly 20
      rectangles. However, the @BoundList's size attribute also
      takes expressions that are evaluated at runtime. More on that in
      <a class="xref" href="#section-expressions" title="9.&nbsp;Expressions">Section&nbsp;9, &#8220;Expressions&#8221;</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="8.&nbsp;Lazy loading lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="d200e92">8.&nbsp;Lazy loading lists</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      Arrays are not the only type of lists supported by default;
      Preon also supports Lists (the java.util.List) kind, as you
      might have expected. There is however a difference with the way
      it treats Lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Preon decodes a List of items from the bit in,
      there is a chance it will inject a lazy-loading List into the
      List type attribute instead of fully-populated eagerly loaded
      List instance. I say there is 'a chance', since it really
      depends on a number of conditions if it will do so. The actual
      conditions are quite complex, but they can be summarized as "the
      principle of the least surprise."
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">
class PseudoMondriaan {
  @BoundList(size="20", type=Rectangle.class)
  private List&lt;Rectangle&gt; rectangles;
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      Preon has a preference for loading data lazily. In the above
      case, the size of each Rectangle instance is known in
      advance. In fact, we know that the number of bits occupied by
      the entire List will be 20 times the size of single
      Rectangle. And we also know that - in order to get the third
      element - we just need to skip over the first two elements (the
      number of bits of a single Rectangle element, multiplied by
      two).
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a lazy loading List is in the above case probably a fairly
      efficient thing to do. There are other cases in which this would
      be much harder, typically when the List item's size is
      determined at runtime. In cases like these, Preon will
      automatically pick an alternative Codec, most likely one that
      eagerly loads the data.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="9.&nbsp;Expressions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-expressions">9.&nbsp;Expressions</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      By now, you probably wondered a couple of times why the size
      attribute on @BoundList and @BoundString accepts String values
      instead of numbers. It seems rather a wasteful, and the compiler
      is not going to help you to make sure you enter numeric values
      in these situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, these attributes expect more than just numeric
      values: a lot of annotations in Preon allow you to pass in
      expressions, instead of numeric values. The size attribute on
      @BoundList and @BoundString are just examples of cases in which
      these expresions are accepted.
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">class PseudoMondriaan {
  @Bound int numberOfRectangles;
  @BoundList(size="numberOfRectangles", type=Rectangle.class)
    List&lt;Rectangle&gt; rectangles;
}</pre>
    <p>
      The example above is still a fairly simple example. It refers to
      a variable called numberOfRectangles, and it's now hard to guess
      how this variable is getting resolved: by default, Preon will
      try to resolve variables into bound attributes defined
      before. (There are other types of references, but let's stick
      with this simple example for now.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you can obviously construct more complex expressions than
      this. And in order to do that, you can use a range of arithmetic
      or logical operators. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">
@BoundList(size="width * height") byte[] pixels;
@BoundNumber(size="nrBits * 2") int value;
// Clearly pointless, but you know...
@BoundString(size="x * (y + z) / 23 ^ t");
    </pre>
  </div>
  <div class="section" title="10.&nbsp;Limbo"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="section-limbo">10.&nbsp;Limbo</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      The expression language used in the examples of the previous
      language is Limbo. Limbo is a fairly small expression language,
      and is explicitly aiming at
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      being as
      feature rich as JSP's EL or OGNL, and for good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, JSP's EL and OGNL allow you to call methods on
      objects. Limbo does
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      allow you to call
      methods, because<span class="emphasis"><em>it wants to capture the meaning of
      the expression explicitly</em></span>. And it would be impossible
      to capture the meaning of your expression if it would involve
      operations defined outside of Limbo itself. So, Limbo works on
      data only, and the number of operators is finite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limbo is not just about evaluating expressions. It also wants to
      capture those expressions in such a way that it will be able to
      generate
      <span class="emphasis"><em>human-readable</em></span>
      expressions from it
      afterwards. So, if these would be the Limbo expressions:
    </p>
    <pre class="screen">width * height
a^2 + b^2 == c^2</pre>
    <p>
      ... then Limbo wants to be capable of turning this into this:
    </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc" compact><li class="listitem">
        <p>

    <p>
      The size attribute defined on the @BoundList annotation
      obviously acts as a type of control mechanism. However, in order
      to be able to deal with the majority of encoding formats, we
      need to introduce a couple of other control structures, in order
      to support with conditionals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the number of places in which you would be able to use a
      condition is again open-ended. Preon is extensible, so you can
      define your own annotations using conditions wherever you
      like. However, the framework supports some by default, and we
      are going to mention two here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first one is the @If annotations. By putting this annotation
      in front of an attribute, you basically state that - whatever
      attribute is following - it should only be decoded if the
      condition inside the @If holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let's see what that means in our example. Let's just say
      that a Shape allows you to specify that you want a dashed
      border, and that it defines some additional attributes allowing
      you to control how the dashes are drawn.
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">
class Shape {
  @Bound Color fillColor;
  @Bound Color borderColor;
  @Bound boolean dashed;
  @If("dashed")
  @Bound int spaceBetweenDashes;
}
    </pre>

      <a class="xref" href="#section-expressions" title="9.&nbsp;Expressions">Section&nbsp;9, &#8220;Expressions&#8221;</a>
      already mentioned that
      Preon does not limit you to refer to other bound attributes on
      the same class only. It also supports the dot operator (to
      access attributes of objects referenced) and the item operator (
      to access items in list-type attributes).
      <a class="xref" href="#example-valid-references" title="Example&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Valid references">Example&nbsp;8, &#8220;Valid references&#8221;</a>
      lists some sample references.

      Another thing that Preon allows you to do is to refer to the
      <em class="firstterm">outer</em>
      context.
      <a class="xref" href="#example-outer-context" title="Example&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Outer context references">Example&nbsp;9, &#8220;Outer context references&#8221;</a>
      relies on this to refer to the
      <code class="envar">bitsPerColorComponent</code>
      variable in the Image, from
      within the RgbColor object.

    <div class="example"><a name="example-outer-context"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Outer context references</b></p><div class="example-contents">

  public class RgbColor {
    @BoundNumber(size="outer.bitsPerColorComponent") red;
    @BoundNumber(size="outer.bitsPerColorComponent") green;
    @BoundNumber(size="outer.bitsPerColorComponent") blue;

    <p>
      Various sections in this chapter already alluded to the fact
      that Preon aims at capturing dependencies between different
      pieces of data explicitly, in order to be able to generate
      documentation. If this is the first time you read about Preon,
      you might wonder what that was all about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preon was born out of unease with an existing situation. In that
      existing situation, one guy was responsible for the software for
      decoding a complicated file format, while another was
      responsible for encoding data; both of them were responsible to
      keep documentation in sync. In the end, everything turned to be
      out of sync. Keeping the encoder in sync with the decoder was
      hard, and the documentation was always out of whack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preon aims to change all of that: it set of to provide a
      framework in which you specify the encoding format once, and get
      decoders, encoders
      <span class="emphasis"><em>and documentation</em></span>
      for
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, how does it work? Well, if you remember the first example in
      this chapter, we constructed a Codec and used a Codec using the
      Codecs class, like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">Codec&lt;Rectangle&gt; codec = Codecs.create(Rectangle.class);
Rectangle rect = Codecs.decode(codec, in);</pre>
    <p>
      Generating documentation just requires using another operation
      on Codecs:
    </p>
    <pre class="programlisting">Codec&lt;Rectangle&gt; codec = Codecs.create(Rectangle.class);
Codecs.document(codec, DocumentType.Html, new File(...);</pre>
    <p>
      When you apply that to<a class="xref" href="#example-shape-inheritance" title="Example&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Shape Inheritance">Example&nbsp;7, &#8220;Shape Inheritance&#8221;</a>, this is what you get:
