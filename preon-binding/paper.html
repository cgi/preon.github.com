        Writing software to deal with compressed media formats is not
        trivial. The same knowledge about the encoded representation
        will often be replicated in both the decoder, the encoder, as
        well as the documentation on the media format. As a consequence,
        the software is hard to maintain. This paper introduces Preon, a
        framework addressing these concerns. Preon allows you to define
        the mapping between an encoded representation and the in-memory
        representation just once, and get the decoder, the encoder and
        documentation for free.

    <p>
      Contrary to popular widespread believe, only a fraction of the
      data stored on disk and traversing the network is encoded in
      XML. A significant portion of the data floating around on the
      Internet is encoded using an abundance of compression
      techniques, often relying on data being encoded in a number of
      bits rather than a number of bytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper introduces Preon, a framework addressing the
      challenges for writing software dealing with binary encoded
      data.

      Writing software capable of dealing with these media formats is

      As a consequence of these complications, most software

      Preon is a framework for dealing with bitstream compressed data,
      addressing the concerns outlined above. Preon originated from an
      attempt to restructure the way to deal with map files and other
      compressed file formats in use at TomTom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preon's scope and ambitions can be summarized like this:

    <p>
      Unlike some of the other approaches that have been taken towards
      this problem (see<a class="xref" href="#section-languages" title="8.&nbsp;Bitstream Structure Description Languages">Section&nbsp;8, &#8220;Bitstream Structure Description Languages&#8221;</a>), Preon
      does
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      rely on XML or a DSL to capture
      the specifics of a format. Instead, it relies on annotations on
      the classes defining the runtime representation of the encoded
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose there is a need to capture how a certain color is
      encoded in some graphical file format, and let us assume that
      the RGB components are values ranging from 0 to 255. Then based
      on that simple model,
      <a class="xref" href="#example-color" title="Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Simple Example">Example&nbsp;1, &#8220;Simple Example&#8221;</a>
      illustrates how you would specify the structure of that format,
      and how it maps to your in-memory data representation.
      <a class="xref" href="#example-decode" title="Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Decoding Color">Example&nbsp;2, &#8220;Decoding Color&#8221;</a>
      illustrates how you would use this
      'specification' to decode a color from a byte array.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-color"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Simple Example</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">class Color {
@Bound byte red;
@Bound byte green;
@Bound byte blue;
}</pre>
    </div></div><br class="example-break">
    <div class="example"><a name="example-decode"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Decoding Color</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">
Codec&lt;Color&gt; codec = Codecs.create(Color.class);
Color color = codecs.decode(codec, new byte[] { 0x33, 0x22, 0x11 });      
</pre>
    </div></div><br class="example-break">
    <p>
      Preon supports the notion of convention over configuration. By
      default, a byte that is marked as @Bound will be decoded based
      on the most natural approach you would expect for decoding a
      byte: take 8 bits from the bitstream, and assume that to be the
      signed representation of the byte you're expecting to
      read. Similarly, an @Bound annotation on a boolean field will
      cause the boolean to be decoded based on a single bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span>
      however be cases in
      which these defaults are not the proper way to go. In some
      cases, you might expect the byte to be encoded in four bits
      only, for instance. In order be more specific on how values
      should be decoded, Preon allows you to use more specific
      annotations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a class="xref" href="#example-color-collection" title="Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Color collection">Example&nbsp;3, &#8220;Color collection&#8221;</a>
      illustrates a situation in
      which specifying more meta data is required. It involves
      collection of colors, in which the format allocates two bytes
      for the number of colors in the collection, and an array of
      colors that holds the definitions of these colors.
    </p>
    <div class="example"><a name="example-color-collection"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Color collection</b></p><div class="example-contents">
      
      <pre class="programlisting">class ColorCollection {
@BoundNumber(size="16") int nrColors;
@BoundList(size="nrColors") Color[] colors;
}</pre>
    </div></div><br class="example-break">
    <p>
      <a class="xref" href="#example-color-collection" title="Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Color collection">Example&nbsp;3, &#8220;Color collection&#8221;</a>
      not only illustrates
      the use of more specific annotations, it also illustrates that
      Preon allows you to define dependencies between different data
      elements: the length of the colors array is based on the number
      of colors provided by nrColors.

      The size attribute on @BoundList in
      <a class="xref" href="#example-color-collection" title="Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Color collection">Example&nbsp;3, &#8220;Color collection&#8221;</a>
      is interpreted as a
      Limbo
      <sup>[<a name="d5e80" href="#ftn.d5e80" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>
      expression. Applied in this context, the expression
      language not only allows you to refer to data previously read in
      that same data structure, but it also allows you point to the
      outer context (for inner classes), to items of collections, and
      to properties of objects. Limbo allows you to build expressions
      by combining these references and literal values using logical
      and arithmetic operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limbo has been designed specifically for Preon. Its support for
      early binding is used when building Codecs for a certain data
      element; if expressions contain invalid references, this will be
      discovered during the construction of the Codec,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
      using the Codec to decode a piece of
      data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early binding capability is not the only difference between
      Limbo and other expression language libraries existing in the
      Java space. Another difference is its support for producing a
      human-readable translation of the expression. Preon's
      support for generation documentation from a Codec relies heavily
      on this capability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="6.&nbsp;Preon Codecs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="d5e86">6.&nbsp;Preon Codecs</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      The Codec constructed as illustrated in
      <a class="xref" href="#example-decode" title="Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Decoding Color">Example&nbsp;2, &#8220;Decoding Color&#8221;</a>
      not only allows you to decode a
      binary representation of the runtime representation of the data
      structure; it
      <span class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span>
      captures everything
      known about that data structure. In fact, it is only capable of
      decoding the binary encoded representation as a consequence of
      the fact that it captures all meta data of the binary encoded
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preon does not generate any source code or byte code. That means
      that - rather than generating a one-of Codec - the Codec is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>assembled</em></span>
      at runtime from smaller Codecs,
      each with their own limited responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      In<a class="xref" href="#example-color" title="Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Simple Example">Example&nbsp;1, &#8220;Simple Example&#8221;</a>, the Codec constructed from
      the Color class is an ObjectCodec that delegates to three
      instances of NumberCodec. The ObjectCodec understands the
      relationship between the object's attributes and the Codecs
      required to decode data into those attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Codec constructed from the other example (<a class="xref" href="#example-color-collection" title="Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Color collection">Example&nbsp;3, &#8220;Color collection&#8221;</a>) is an ObjectCodec that
      delegates to a NumberCodec and a ListCodec. The ListCodec in
      turn relies on an ObjectCodec for Color instances, which - as we
      have seen before - relies on three NumberCodecs to decode the
      bytes representing the RGB components of that color.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a class="xref" href="#fig-codec" title="Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Codecs Linked to Data Structure">Figure&nbsp;1, &#8220;Codecs Linked to Data Structure&#8221;</a>
      depicts the relationship between the
      the classes representing a data structure at runtime, and the
      Codecs responsible for decoding the data from its binary encoded
      representation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating Codecs this way has a number of important benefits. The
      most important benefit is that it makes the framework
      extensible. Codecs that delegate to other Codecs do not need to
      have deep insight into the specifics of the Codecs they are
      targeting. The Codec interface is fairly simply, and really
      abstract. If in the future, there would be other types of Codecs
      to delegate to (Codecs that would decode data using compression
      techniques not yet known today), then the governing Codec does
      not need to know about the specifics in order to use that new
      type of Codec it's delegating to. (See also<a class="xref" href="#section-flavor" title="8.1.&nbsp;Flavor">Section&nbsp;8.1, &#8220;Flavor&#8221;</a>.)

    <p>
      Given the fact that Preon captures all meta data known on a file
      format into a tree of Codecs, it is also capable of leveraging
      that meta data to generate documentation on the file
      format. And, as with decoding the data, the process of building
      documentation is broken apart and delegated to each individual
      Codec that is part of the chain of responsibility hanging of the
      top level Codec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, when requesting documentation based on a certain
      Codec (see<a class="xref" href="#example-build-documentation" title="Example&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Building documentation">Example&nbsp;4, &#8220;Building documentation&#8221;</a>), the
      process will figure out how to best organize the document, and
      then give every Codec the change to render itself in the most
      appropriate way.

      Preon is not the first attempt to capture bitstream structure in
      a formal way. There are a number of initiatives working in a
      similar direction. This paper is not aiming at providing a full
      overview of all of these other initiatives. It will only
      highlight some of them, in order to illustrate the differences
      with the approach Preon is taking.

      <p>
        Flavor
        <a class="xref" href="#bib-flavor-1">[4]</a>
        offers a DSL for
        defining the structure of a bitstream. The tool-chain rewrites
        specifications written in this DSL into C++ and Java sources
        for both the decoding and encoding logic, as well as the
        classes capable of capturing the data structures encoded in
        the bitstream. Data will be decoded in a single pass, and the
        entire data structure needs to fit on the heap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flavor was one of the solutions originally considered when
        searching for an alternative solution for decoding TomTom map
        files. Unfortunately, Flavor is not extensible; it is
        impossible to add support for other compression techniques
        without rewriting the code generator that takes Flavor input
        and produces Java / C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preon allows you to extend its support for compression
        techniques by implementing a number of interfaces, and
        registering these extensions with the framework at
        runtime. The extensions may be triggered by annotations,
        particular data types, or by combinations of annotations and
        particular data types.
        <a class="xref" href="#example-extension" title="Example&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Potential Extension">Example&nbsp;5, &#8220;Potential Extension&#8221;</a>
        illustrates a situation in which an extension is triggered by
        a new annotation introduced by the extension. Note how the
        framework supports using the new annotation in combination
        with other, predefined annotations.
      </p>
      <div class="example"><a name="example-extension"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Potential Extension</b></p><div class="example-contents">
        
        <pre class="programlisting">@BoundHuffmanCoded(...) String name;

</pre>
      </div></div><br class="example-break">
      <p>
        Flavor's processing model also turned out to be problematic
        for processing map data. Flavor is only capable of reading the
        entire data structure into memory in a single pass. All of the
        map data in a 1.5 GB map file would - once uncompressed - be
        much larger than feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preon will
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
        read the entire data
        structure in a single pass. By default, it will determine
        which parts of the data structure can be loaded lazily, and
        then choose to do so. The paradigm is closer to random access
        than streaming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last, but not least, when examining Flavor for use on map
        files, it turned out that the API constructed by it is not
        threadsafe. Preon can be accessed by multiple threads, in case
        the data is read from a ConcurrentBitBuffer that it it

      <p>
        The Erlang programming language has support for bitstream
        structure descriptions built into the language<a class="xref" href="#bib-erlang-bit-syntax" title="The bit syntax">[3]</a>. The actual description is
        specified as a pattern, which can then - using Erlang's
        pattern matching syntax - be used to break a bitstream apart
        into its different constituents, and stored in the
        corresponding variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Erlang's bit syntax is powerful, and its tight
        integration with the language is a bless, it also has
        limitations. First of all, it most well fit for flat data
        structures, without any nesting or interdependencies between
        different data elements read. In case of more complicated data
        structures, Erlang's bit syntax is still a convenient tool,
        but it
        <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span>
        require writing some
        imperative code to deal with the complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preon supports a wider range of data structures out of the
        box. However, given the huge number of compression techniques
        out there, it will not be enough to cater for every existing
        encoding format. In order to deal with that, Preon offers
        its extension points, allowing you to make your own extensions
        as well supported as the encoding techniques supported out of
        the box.

      <p>
        XFlavor
        <a class="xref" href="#bib-xflavor" title="XFlavor">[2]</a>
        is an extension of
        Flavor, supporting XML features. It takes the Flavor syntax of
        a bitstream structure description, and turns it into XML. The
        MPEG-21 Bitstream Syntax Description Language is a tool of the
        MPEG-21 specification, to assist in customizing scalable
        bitstreams. BFlavor and gBFlavor combine these different
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although all of these technologies address problems in the
        same space as Preon, the emphasis seems to be on streaming
        data, and the approach is quite different than Preon's. There
        seems to be an emphasis on using XML in all of these
        technologies. Preon opted for capturing the bitstream syntax
        description in a programming language, to avoid having to
        generate source code, and to be able to not only capture meta
        data on a particular encoding technique, but also its
        behaviour.

      <p>
        Although Preon is clearly targeting a different on disk
        representation of the data, it shares some similarities with
        Java data binding frameworks such as JAXB, and Hibernate. Just
        like JAXB And Hibernate, the classes defining the in-memory
        representation are annotated to define it relation with the
        encoded representation. In JAXB, that encoded representation
        is XML. In Hibernate, the encoded representation is a number
        of tables in a relational database. In Preon, the encoded
        representation is a sequence of bits.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be possible to harmonize Preon with these frameworks on
        an API level, but it's questionable if there would be
        immediate benefits from doing so.

    <p>
      Preon has been in development for a couple of years now. Its use
      has already been demonstrated on various file formats, including
      various file formats capturing geographical data, MPEG headers
      and image file formats. In March this year, Preon was used to
      capture the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>full</em></span>
      structure of a Java Class
      file, resulting in the construction of a Java byte code decoder
      without a single line of imperative code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In April this year, Preon's documentation generation mechanism
      was revised. A release is planned before summer 2009. That
      release will not support encoding though. Early versions of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>encoding</em></span>
      support have been removed from the
      code base. There have been a number of discussions on the types
      of encoding support (streaming, in-place, etc.) should be
      supported. The aim is to eventually have support for encoding to
      an output stream, and to start work on that after Preon's first
      release.

    <p>
      This paper presented Preon, a new way of dealing with
      binary/bitstream encoded data. Preon is designed to capture the
      encoded representation and its mapping to the in-memory runtime
      representation<span class="emphasis"><em>only once</em></span>, and receive the
      decoder, the encoder
      <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
      documentation on
      the format of the encoded representation for free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preon has been put to the test in various situations; mostly for
      decoding geographical data from various proprietary geographical
      file formats, but also for image file formats and Java
      bytecode. It's extensible, can work in a threadsafe mode, and
      offers a way to pull in data on demand, in order to minimize the
      impact on the heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preon will first be released without support for encoding data;
      support for encoding is on the roadmap for the first release
      after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preon's meta model of the encoded representation continuous to
      be a source of inspiration for future work. It should be
      possible to use that meta model to generate diagrams of the
      format. It should also be possible to rely on Preon's meta model
      to annotate hexdumps, in order to explain the different bits and
      pieces of that hexdump.
